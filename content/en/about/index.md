## 👋 Hi! I'm Alejandro Fábrega
I'm a Python developer specialized in **Django**, **Odoo**, **FastAPI**, and **Flask**, with experience as a **Linux SysAdmin**, **Git** user, and **IoT** tinkerer.

I'm also a **Fishing Engineer** based at the end of the world 🌎 — **Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina**. I'm passionate about **Free and Open Source Software** ❤️, not just as a tool, but as a foundation for **technological sovereignty** and collaborative knowledge.

I value **digital minimalism** — building simple, clean, and efficient solutions that do more with less. This blog is a space where I share ideas, tutorials, tools, and lessons learned along the way (including the mistakes).
My CV is available [here](/cv).
